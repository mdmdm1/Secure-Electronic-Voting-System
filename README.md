Secure Electronic Voting System

This project involves developing a secure web-based electronic voting application using Java J2EE, MySQL, and security measures such as RSA encryption. The system is designed with two central authorities for voter identification and vote counting, ensuring that neither authority can tamper with the results independently. The project aims to address existing issues in electronic voting applications, such as security vulnerabilities, counting errors, and difficulties in remote voting.

Key Features:

Secure vote encryption and transmission
Separate authorities for voter identification and vote counting
Access control and role management
Compatibility with multiple operating systems
High security standards to protect sensitive data
Technologies Used:

Java J2EE
MySQL for database management
Java security libraries for encryption (RSA, etc.)
